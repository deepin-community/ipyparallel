.SH NAME
ipcluster \- start an IPython cluster
.SH DESCRIPTION
Start an IPython cluster for parallel computing.
.PP
An IPython cluster consists of 1 controller and 1 or more engines. This command
automates the startup of these processes using a wide range of startup methods
(SSH, local processes, PBS, mpiexec, SGE, LSF, HTCondor, Slurm, Windows HPC
Server 2008). To start a cluster with 4 engines on your local host simply do
\&'ipcluster start \fB\-\-n\fR=\fI\,4\/\fR'. For more complex usage you will typically do 'ipython
profile create mycluster \fB\-\-parallel\fR', then edit configuration files, followed by
\&'ipcluster start \fB\-\-profile\fR=\fI\,mycluster\/\fR \fB\-\-n\fR=\fI\,4\/\fR'.
.PP
Subcommands
\fB\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\fR
.PP
Subcommands are launched as `ipcluster cmd [args]`. For information on using
subcommand 'cmd', do: `ipcluster cmd \fB\-h\fR`.
.PP
\fBstart\fR
.IP
Start an IPython cluster for parallel computing
.IP
Start an ipython cluster by its profile name or cluster
directory. Cluster directories contain configuration, log and
security related files and are named using the convention
\&'profile_<name>' and should be creating using the 'start'
subcommand of 'ipcluster'. If your cluster directory is in
the cwd or the ipython directory, you can simply refer to it
using its profile name, 'ipcluster start \fB\-\-n\fR=\fI\,4\/\fR \fB\-\-profile=\fR<profile>`,
otherwise use the 'profile\-dir' option.
.PP
\fBstop\fR
.IP
Stop a running IPython cluster
.IP
Stop a running ipython cluster by its profile name or cluster
directory. Cluster directories are named using the convention
\&'profile_<name>'. If your cluster directory is in
the cwd or the ipython directory, you can simply refer to it
using its profile name, 'ipcluster stop \fB\-\-profile=\fR<profile>`, otherwise
use the '\-\-profile\-dir' option.
.PP
\fBengines\fR
.IP
Start engines connected to an existing IPython cluster
.IP
Start one or more engines to connect to an existing Cluster
by profile name or cluster directory.
Cluster directories contain configuration, log and
security related files and are named using the convention
\&'profile_<name>' and should be creating using the 'start'
subcommand of 'ipcluster'. If your cluster directory is in
the cwd or the ipython directory, you can simply refer to it
using its profile name, 'ipcluster engines \fB\-\-n\fR=\fI\,4\/\fR \fB\-\-profile=\fR<profile>`,
otherwise use the 'profile\-dir' option.
.PP
nbextension
.IP
Enable/disable IPython clusters tab in Jupyter notebook
.IP
for Jupyter Notebook >= 4.2, you can use the new nbextension API:
.IP
jupyter serverextension enable \fB\-\-py\fR ipyparallel
jupyter nbextension install \fB\-\-py\fR ipyparallel
jupyter nbextension enable \fB\-\-py\fR ipyparallel
.PP
To see all available configurables, use \fB\-\-help\-all\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
ipcluster start \fB\-\-n\fR=\fI\,4\/\fR # start a 4 node cluster on localhost
.TP
ipcluster start \fB\-h\fR    # show the help string for the start subcmd
.TP
ipcluster stop \fB\-h\fR     # show the help string for the stop subcmd
.TP
ipcluster engines \fB\-h\fR  # show the help string for the engines subcmd
